# FrontEndProject

This was the first project in DigitalCrafts bootcamp to soley focus on front end development. We implemented two API's to fetch the data and read API documentation. This project also helped us understand the different JS methods to dynamically display content on the screen.

How to use all features:

- The user selects a country and types a city in the search bar
- Upon submission, the website will display local date/time, weather, and the top 15 news of the city
- The top 15 news are links to news articles. Once clicked, a new tab in the browser directs the user to the specific article
- The user is able to search again for new content or click on the title to refresh the page
